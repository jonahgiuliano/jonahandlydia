### Jonah Giuliano (with an insanely large photo I need to resize)

![Unrealistically moody picture of Jonah playing dulcimer](jonah_dulcimer.jpg)
Jonah Giuliano is a Brooklyn-based multi-instrumentalist. Originally from Maryland, he grew up playing drums in Baltimore’s experimental scene, and became exposed to traditional music over the course of many summers at Common Ground on the Hill, where he was first introduced to the mountain dulcimer by Susan Boyer Haley. Jonah’s idiosyncratic and largely self-taught approach to dulcimer is informed by an omnivorous musical palette, ranging from Appalachian old time to avant-garde jazz to the works of J.S. Bach.
